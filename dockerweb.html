                    <h1>Docker Containers</h1>
                    <p>🛡️ Docker containers are a way to package software so it runs the same anywhere — on a laptop, server, or in the cloud.</p>
                    <p>🌌 This means your services and systems can be deployed more quickly and consistently, with fewer technical issues.</p>
                    <p>🎯 Containers are lightweight, efficient, and easy to update, reducing downtime and improving reliability. </p>
                    <p>🔧 They also make it easier to scale services when demand increases, like during peak periods.</p>
                    <p>🌱 With a DevOps Specialist, you bring in someone who can use this technology to modernise your systems, improve digital service delivery, and future-proof your IT infrastructure.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="infoBlock" >
                    <h1>Kubernetes</h1>
                    <p>🛡️ Kubernetes is a system that helps manage and scale software applications automatically. </p>
                    <p>🌌 It ensures that essential digital services stay online, recover quickly from problems, and adapt to changing demand without manual effort.</p>
                    <p>🎯 This means more reliable online systems, faster delivery of new features, and less risk of service outages./p>
                    <p>🔧 Kubernetes also supports better use of resources, lowering costs while improving performance.</p>
                    <p>🌱 With a DevOps Specialist, you gain someone who can implement this technology to strengthen your digital infrastructure and support smarter, more resilient public services.</p>
